#Pong
# The original Pong game


#Things I learned today:

# Important/Ease of separating sections in code with classes rather than combining it all and leaving it messy and hard to read.
# Usage of the shapesize function in the Turtle package
# How to make the ball have a 'bounce' effect by essentially multiplying the 'x' or 'y' value of the ball by '*= -1' or '*= +1*
# ^ See 'bounce_x' and 'bounce_y' functions in the 'ball.py' class
# How to detect if the 'paddle' missed the ball and how to reset the position of everything and start over
